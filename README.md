# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
 Is the process of developing, designing, testing and maintaining a software.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
 software engineering is the process of developing, designing, testing and maintaining  a software, it is extended over the entire lifecycle of the software like  while traditional programming is centred on the code only.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Its a process model used to design, develop and test good quality software.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Agile is a repetitive project management approach for buildings softwares.
Waterfall model is a fundamental model of the SDLC which is used in creation of product development.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In Agile moodel the changes can be made at any stage while in waterfall model the changes cannot be made after completion.
In Agile the client input is required throuhout the product development while in waterfall the client input is reequired only after completing each phase
The cost development for agile is less compared to waterfall model.
Agile completes the projects a short period of time compared to waterfall model.
Agile Model is preffered by project that require constant improvement.
Waterfall model is prefffered to be used during project development.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirement engineering is the process of defining, documentating and maintaining the requirements in the engineering design process.

It is usually a systematic and strict approach to the defination, creation and verification of requirement for software system. It helps in understanding, recording and managing the customers demands.

It informs everyone who is involed with the project and what is to be done.
It enables the software team to establish their goals and scope
It avoids miscommunication during the software development creation.



Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
It is usually aimed in creating a software in a way that it minimizes the dependencies among componets of the system.

Modularity enhances scalability by breaking down the software into independent modules hence becomes easy to replace parts of the system without affecting others.

 Modularity enhances maintainability since it becomes easy to mainrain the system since it has been divided into small modules.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit testing
It is a type of testing which is performed during the early development process by engineers themselves. It ensures the code developer correctly,
 
 Intergration testing
 It is a typeo testing which is used to verity whether the combined units work well together as a group. It is aimed in detecting flaws in the interactions between the units  within module.

 System testing
 It is usually done to the whole system to mconform if it operating corectly as required. It verifies the products compliance with the functional and technical requirement.

 Acceptance testing 
 It is the last stage of the testing process, it is where the product is validated aganist the end user requirements.It helps the team decide if the product is ready to be shipped

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version controlled systems
This are software sysytems thhat help the user to manage changes to source code over time.

It helps the devolopers to move faster when creating the software projects and also manage the software creation team to preserve efficiency ang agility.


Git(distributed)
Compatibility
Git is compatible with all the operating system that are being used. Git repositories can also access the repositories of other version control systems.

Non linear Development
Git allows users all over the world to perform operations on a project remotely, A user can pick any part of the project and do the required operation.

Branching
Git allows its users to work on aline taht runs parallel to the main project files.

Light weight
Git stores data from all centred repositories on to the local repository while cloning is done.

Speed
Git as alot of speed compared to other version control systems.


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Project manager creates the idea of the project which is to be developed.
He/she builds buids the development team which is used develop the softwares.
He confirms the project once its done developed.
He is suppose to analyze constraints and establish project objectives.


lack of skills
When the project manager does not have the skills required in the development of the project then it becames a challenge.

Lack of accountability
When something has gone wrong during creation of the software then each and every person should be accountable for the problem.

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software mainteinace is the process of modifying, acceptingchanging and modifying a software to make to meet users needs.

Corrective mainteinance
Adaptive maintainance
preventive mainteinance
Condition-based mainteinance

Mainteinace is essential since it helps the software to be up to date and also prevents any kind of viruses from attacking the software like preventive mainteinance.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Wrong priorities
A software engineer may devote its time in creating new feartures and improving the functionality of their product hence neglect to customized and improve exsiting functionalities.

Data privacy
The user  data should be taken care of to prevent any uauthorised person to access it and endup using it for thei own benefits.

Ensure software is reliable, safe and meets user needs.
They must be accountable for any kind of mistake they do.
They should attend training schools so as to be taught the skills required.
Their should be a reward for a person who shows ethical behaving so as to encourage others to do so.
they should be good role models for each other.

I have used platforms like geeksforgeeks for reference.
